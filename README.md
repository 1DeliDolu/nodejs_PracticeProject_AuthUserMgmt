# Node.js Practice: Auth & User Management

A minimal, opinionated starter demonstrating basic authentication and user-management patterns in Node.js. This repository is a compact learning project with an Express entrypoint and a simple `router` example.

**Highlights**

- Lightweight example of auth + user management patterns
- Minimal, easy-to-read code for learning and extension
- Example route handler in `router/friends.js`

## Features

- Basic authentication scaffolding (example)
- Simple user management patterns
- Demonstrative `router` structure for modular routes

## Prerequisites

- Node.js v14+ (recommended)
- npm or yarn

## Quick Start

Clone the repo and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd nodejs_PracticeProject_AuthUserMgmt
npm install
```

Run the app:

```bash
# If package.json defines a start script
npm start

# or run the entry file directly
node index.js
```

The server defaults to `PORT=3000` unless configured via environment variables.

## Configuration

Use environment variables for runtime configuration. Common examples:

- `PORT` — server port (default: 3000)
- `JWT_SECRET` — secret key for JWTs (if applicable)

Create a `.env` file or set variables in your environment for local development.

## Project Structure

- [index.js](index.js) — application entrypoint
- [router/friends.js](router/friends.js) — example route module
- [package.json](package.json) — project metadata and scripts
- [LICENSE](LICENSE) — project license

## Usage / API

This project is intentionally small; inspect the route handlers to see available endpoints. Example:

```bash
# Visit the base URL
curl http://localhost:3000/
```

The `router/friends.js` file demonstrates how modular routes are mounted — open it to see available endpoints and expected payloads.

## Extending This Project

- Add persistent storage (MongoDB, PostgreSQL, etc.)
- Add real authentication (JWT, Passport, OAuth)
- Add validation and tests
- Add containerization (Docker) and CI workflows

## Tests

There are no tests included by default. To add testing, consider Jest or Mocha and add a `test` script in `package.json`.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome — make a fork, open a branch, and submit a PR describing the change.

## License

See [LICENSE](LICENSE).

---

If you'd like, I can: add example `.env` and `.env.example`, run the app to verify it starts, or expand the README with API examples based on the actual route handlers. Which would you prefer next?
